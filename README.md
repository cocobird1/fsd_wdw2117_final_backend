# Pokémon Tracker

This repository includes the backend for a Pokemon Tracker web application. The application allows users to learn about the statistics, name, and descriptions of all the original 151 Pokémon through a detailed Pokédex page for each Pokémon. Further, the application allows users to test their knowledge with a quiz with infinite questions. I've implemented a minimalistic but modern user interface that takes advantage of the cool GIFs of Pokémon available online. The dataset is from https://gist.github.com/santiagoolivar2017/0591a53c4dd34ecd8488660c7372b0e3 which is published on GitHub.

This application uses a React frontend (https://github.com/cocobird1/fsd_wdw2117_final_frontend) with a Node js backend (this repository) and a MongoDB database. This application is hosted at https://fsd-wdw2117-final-frontend.vercel.app/pokemon.
